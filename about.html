            <strong>What is Openbook?</strong>
            <p>Openbook draws attention to the information Facebook makes public about its users via its search API.  Facebook exposed this service on April 21st, 2010.</p>
            <p>
              Our goal is to get Facebook to restore the privacy of this information, so that this website and others like it no longer work.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have questions, or are a media person, you can email Will and Peter at:  <a href="mailto:facepalm.inquiries@gmail.com">facepalm.inquiries@gmail.com</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              This website is a parody, and has no relationship to Facebook.
            </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What has Facebook done wrong?</strong>
            <p>
              Facebook has made two clear mistakes here.  First, they do not do a good job of indicating how public each piece of information you share on the site will be.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, <a href='http://mattmckeon.com/facebook-privacy/'>they change the rules far too often</a>. If you understood Facebook's privacy settings two years ago (or even six months ago) that information would be worse than useless with today's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/05/12/business/facebook-privacy.html">bewildering settings</a>.
            </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Do I need to be logged into Facebook?</strong>
        <p><strong>No!</strong> Anybody can search, even if they don't have a Facebook account. However, if you do have a Facebook account, you get the added bonus of fulling profile pages when you click on a user.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What should I do with my Facebook account?</strong>
          <p><a href="http://www.reclaimprivacy.org/">ReclaimPrivacy.org</a> has an excellent tool that will show you what is public about your profile, and makes it very simple and easy to secure your <a href="http://www.reclaimprivacy.org/facebook">privacy settings</a>.
          </p>
            
          <p>Many people feel that Facebook has violated their trust, and are <a href='http://www.quitfacebookday.com/'>pledging to delete their accounts on May 31st.</a>
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Are you guys HACKING FACEBOOK!?!?!?!</strong>
          <p>No.  We are using <a href='http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api#search'>Facebook's documented APIs</a>.  It's a completely public API that any programmer can use.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Who are we?</strong>
            <p>We are three Facebook users concerned about privacy.  We work as software engineers and designers in San Francisco.</p>

        <strong>Who built Openbook?  How?  When?</strong>
          <p>
            Concept and Code by <a href="http://github.com/willmoffat">Will Moffat</a> and  <a href="http://github.com/rictic">Peter Burns</a>.<br />
            Design by <a href="http://jameshome.com">James Home</a>.<br />
            Icons by <a href="http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons/">Fat Cow</a> and <a href="http://ajaxload.info/">Ajaxload</a>.<br />
            Hosted on the awesome <a href="http://github.com/willmoffat/FacebookSearch/tree/gh-pages">GitHub pages</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Openbook is a pure client-side HTML, JS and CSS app that makes <a href="http://graph.facebook.com/search?q=playing+hookey&amp;type=post">simple requests</a> to the Facebook API.  We started working on it late Wednesday night (May 12th 2010) and had the site working within an hour or two.  Since then the only substantive changes we've made have been to the design and presentation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How much traffic are you getting?</strong>
            <p>We wrote the site Wednesday night.  </p>

              <table class='traffic_stats'>
                <tr><th>Date</th>      <th>Hits</th>     <th>Visitors</th>   </tr>
                <tr><td>Thursday</td>  <td>10,865</td>   <td>3,262</td>      </tr>
                <tr><td>Friday</td>    <td>131,895</td>  <td>38,121</td>     </tr>
                <tr><td>Saturday</td>  <td>226,916</td>  <td>58,959</td>     </tr>
                <tr><td>Sunday</td>    <td>319,586</td>  <td>77,148</td>     </tr>
              </table>

              <p>As I write this on noon PST, Monday we're seeing 13.72 queries per second (averaged over the last minute).</p>
              <p>As of 2pm PST we're getting 17 queries per second.
